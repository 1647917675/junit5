[[release-notes-5.0.0-rc1-junit-platform]]
==== JUnit Platform

===== Bug Fixes

* Generic, interface `default` methods that are not overridden by an implementing class
  can now be _selected_ by class, method name, and parameter types or by _fully qualified
  method name_. This applies to method selectors in `DiscoverySelectors` as well as to
  both `findMethod()` variants in `ReflectionSupport`.
* A non-overridden interface default method whose method signature is overloaded by a
  locally declared method is now properly discovered when searching for methods within a
  class hierarchy using `findMethods()` in `ReflectionSupport`.

===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Removed deprecated method `execute(LauncherDiscoveryRequest)` from `Launcher` class.
  The removed method was replaced in milestone 4 by method
  `execute(LauncherDiscoveryRequest, TestExecutionListener...)`.


[[release-notes-5.0.0-rc1-junit-jupiter]]
==== JUnit Jupiter

===== Bug Fixes

* Configuration errors regarding lifecycle methods annotated with `@BeforeAll`,
  `@AfterAll`, `BeforeEach`, or `@AfterEach` no longer halt the execution of the entire
  test plan during the discovery phase. Rather, such errors are now reported during the
  execution of the affected test class.
* A non-overridden interface default method whose method signature is overloaded by a
  locally declared method is now properly included in the test plan. This applies to
  default methods annotated with Jupiter annotations such as `@Test, `@BeforeEach`, etc.
